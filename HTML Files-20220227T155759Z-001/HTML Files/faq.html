                    No, the website only displays the available sellers and the prices they offer.
                    Users upon mutual agreement decide on a payment method and complete the 
                    transaction when they meet at a common area.

                    The price displayed for a certain book is decided by the seller.
                    This cannot be changed , unless the user agrees to sell it
                    for a different price after discussion.

                    The user and seller would have to declare a transaction complete 
                    after which that book from that seller would be removed from list
                    wher buyers usual see the different sell options.
